# Yummy Burger App!
A burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM
Node and MySQL is used to query and route data in this app, Handlebars is used to generate HTML.

My Yummy Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
